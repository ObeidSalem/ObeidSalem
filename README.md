# 👋 Hi, I'm Obeid Salem

**Software Engineer | System Architecture | Engineering Leadership**

I design and deliver scalable enterprise platforms that make sense — technically and commercially.

Over 3+ years of experience building web and mobile systems that:

- Generated 100,000+ SAR in annual cost savings by engineering in-house systems that replaced third-party tools
- Accelerated platform performance by 60%, delivering faster, more reliable user experiences
- Powering critical systems used daily by 200+ internal users in production

I work closely with product and business stakeholders, translating complex requirements into clean system designs and leading teams to deliver high-impact, production-ready systems.
